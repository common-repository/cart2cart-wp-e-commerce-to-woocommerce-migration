== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= Is there a possibility to migrate customer passwords to WooCommerce? =
Yes, of course. With the WP e-Commerce to WooCommerce service by Cart2Cart, you can transfer your WP e-Commerce store customers’ passwords, provided that the store has default settings and no custom code modifications have been made.

= Does the plugin support the migration of the credit card information from WP e-Commerce to WooCommerce? =
Yes, Cart2Cart supports the migration of the credit card information in case such data were provided by customers. Billing and shipping addresses' information will be moved successfully too.

= Is it possible to migrate metadata from WP e-Commerce to WooCommerce? =
Yes, Cart2Cart supports metadata migration across these shopping carts. More specifically, you can transfer meta titles, keywords, and descriptions to your new WooCommerce store. However, keep in mind that the [WordPress SEO Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) (it’s free) is installed before the migration.

= Can I preserve my WP e-Commerce store order IDs while migrating to the new WooCommerce store? =
